# abapGitcustomizing
abapGit for customizing content

# Motivation
Since more and more developers are started using [abapGit](https://docs.abapgit.org/), we have now many open source projects in ABAP. The abapGit works with TADIR objects which are created under a package. But the tool lacks the support for customizing content i.e. TABU, VDAT, CDAT, TDAT or TLOGO objects.


# Idea
Use existing customizing tool [Business Configuration Sets](https://help.sap.com/viewer/521cd184dd2f491a9a4179edb66951c3/7.52.6/en-US/4da559a1327f212de10000000a42189e.html) to handle the customizing content.

# Prerequisite
Developer version of [abapGit](https://docs.abapgit.org/guide-install.html#install-developer-version) is installed in the system.

# Installation
Install the repo via abapGit.

# Transaction
